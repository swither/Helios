# Helios Task List
## About
This is a list of outstanding tasks which have not or cannot be linked to specific files, but need to show up in the VS task list.
The keywords do not seem to work in this file type, so  `Ctrl+K, Ctrl+H` to create a task shortcut in the task list. 
## Tasks

[ ] Remove the interface build code for the Mosquito implementation
